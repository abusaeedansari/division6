    question: "You have 120 apples and put them equally into 8 boxes. How many apples in each box?",
    options: ["10", "12", "15", "20"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Imagine you have 120 apples and you want to share them equally among 8 boxes. If you divide 120 by 8, each box will get the same number of apples. So, 120 ÷ 8 = 15. That means each box has 15 apples."
  },
  {
    type: "mcq",
    question: "If 9 × 4 = 36, which division fact is correct?",
    options: ["36 ÷ 9 = 3", "36 ÷ 4 = 9", "36 ÷ 6 = 6", "36 ÷ 3 = 12"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "We know that 9 multiplied by 4 equals 36. To find the division fact, we reverse the multiplication. So, if 9 × 4 = 36, then 36 ÷ 4 = 9. That means 36 ÷ 4 = 9 is the correct division fact."
  },
  {
    type: "tf",
    question: "True or False: Dividing a number by 1 gives the number itself.",
    options: ["True", "False"],
    correct: "True",
    explanation: "When you divide any number by 1, the number stays the same. For example, 5 ÷ 1 is still 5. So, dividing a number by 1 gives the number itself. This statement is True."
  },
  {
    type: "mcq",
    question: "If 56 ÷ 7 = ? Select the correct answer.",
    options: ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    correct: 2,

    type: "mcq",
    question: "What is 600 ÷ 100?",
    options: ["6", "60", "600", "0"],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: "When you divide 600 by 100, you're seeing how many hundreds are in 600. Since 100 fits into 600 six times, 600 ÷ 100 = 6. So, the correct answer is 6."
  },
  {
    type: "tf",
    question: "True or False: 48 ÷ 6 = 8",
    options: ["True", "False"],

  },
  {
    type: "mcq",
    question: "200 ÷ 10 = ?",
    options: ["2", "20", "200", "0"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Dividing 200 by 10 tells us how many tens are in 200. Since 10 fits into 200 exactly 20 times, 200 ÷ 10 = 20. So, the correct answer is 20."
